                <p>The blade of a cricket bat is a wooden block that is generally flat on the striking face and with a ridge on the reverse (back) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit. The bat is traditionally made from willow
                    wood, specifically from a variety of White Willow called Cricket Bat Willow (Salix alba var. caerulea), treated with raw (unboiled) linseed oil, which has a protective function.

                <p>A cricket ball is a hard, solid ball used to play cricket. A cricket ball consists of cork covered by leather, and manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The manipulation of a cricket ball, through employment of
                    its various physical properties, is a staple component of bowling and dismissing batsmen.

                <figcaption><strong>cricket stump</strong></figcaption>
                <p>The stumps are three vertical posts which support two bails. The stumps and bails are usually made of wood, most commonly ash, and together form a wicket at each end of the pitch.The overall width of each wicket is 9 inches (22.9 cm).
                    Each stump is 28 inches (71.1 cm) tall with maximum and minimum diameters of 1 1⁄2 inches (3.81 cm) and 1 3⁄8 inches (3.49 cm). They have a spike at one end for inserting into the ground, and the other end has a U-shaped 'through groove'
                    to provide a resting place for the bails. In junior cricket the items have lesser dimensions.Each stump is referred to by a specific name:Off stump is the stump on the off side of the wicket (the same side as the batsman's bat). Middle
                    stump is the centre stump, the middle of the three stumps.Leg stump is the stump on the on side of the wicket (the same side as the batsman's legs).

            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field, at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket (a set of three wooden stumps) sited at each end. One team, designated the
                batting team, attempts to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents field. Each phase of play is called an innings. After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a fixed number of overs have been completed, the innings ends
                and the two teams then swap roles. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained, during their one or two innings.</p>
